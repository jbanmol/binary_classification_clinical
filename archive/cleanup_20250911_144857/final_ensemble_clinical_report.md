- ‚úÖ **Balanced** approach to minimize both false positives and negatives
- ‚úÖ **Your V4.2 approach meets these targets**

### üîß **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE**

#### For Clinical Deployment:
1. **Use your V4.2 Random Forest** as the primary model
2. **Apply threshold 0.568** for balanced performance
3. **Implement confidence intervals** to indicate prediction certainty
4. **Consider two-stage screening**:
   - Stage 1: High sensitivity threshold (0.4-0.5) for initial screening
   - Stage 2: Your proven threshold (0.568) for clinical assessment

#### For Different Clinical Contexts:
- **High Sensitivity Context** (early screening): Threshold ~0.4 (85% sens, 35% spec)
- **Balanced Context** (standard practice): **Your V4.2 threshold 0.568** 
- **High Specificity Context** (resource-limited): Threshold ~0.7 (60% sens, 80% spec)

## üî¨ SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS

### What We Learned About the Clinical Problem:

1. **Feature Limitation**: Current behavioral features have intrinsic limitations for simultaneous high sensitivity and specificity
2. **Trade-off Universality**: The trade-off exists across all model types and ensemble strategies
3. **Threshold Dependency**: Performance is highly sensitive to threshold selection
4. **Clinical Reality**: Your original V4.2 approach represents near-optimal performance for this feature set

### Implications for ASD Detection Research:

1. **Feature Innovation Needed**: Achieving 86% sensitivity requires new feature types:
   - Temporal behavioral patterns
   - Multi-modal data (video, audio, physiological)
   - More detailed social interaction features
   - Developmental trajectory features

2. **Dataset Expansion**: Larger, more diverse datasets might reveal better separability
3. **Alternative Paradigms**: Multi-stage screening or hierarchical models may be more effective
